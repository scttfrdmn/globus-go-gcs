# Project Summary: Security & Performance v2.0

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Breaking Change for Security

**v2.0 removes the ability to pass secrets as CLI arguments** - this is a security-critical change required for HIPAA/PHI compliance.

**üìñ READ FIRST**: [BREAKING_CHANGES_V2.md](./BREAKING_CHANGES_V2.md)

**Summary**:
- **What**: Secrets no longer accepted as command-line arguments (--secret-access-key, --client-secret, etc.)
- **Why**: CLI arguments are visible in `ps` output and shell history (NIST 800-53 IA-5(7) violation)
- **How to migrate**: Use interactive prompts, stdin pipes (--secret-stdin), or environment variables (--secret-env)
- **Affected**: 5 commands (user-credential s3-keys, oidc create/update)

## Key Features

### Security (NIST 800-53 Compliance)

**Critical Improvements**:
1. **Token Encryption** (#1) - AES-256-GCM with keyring integration
2. **TLS Hardening** (#2) - TLS 1.2+ with secure cipher suites
3. **Secret Input** (#3) - Remove secrets from CLI args (stdin/prompt)
4. **Audit Encryption** (#4) - SQLCipher for encrypted audit database
5. **CSRF Tokens** (#5) - Cryptographically secure random generation

**High Priority Improvements**:
- Comprehensive input validation
- Error message sanitization
- Session timeout enforcement
- API rate limiting with retry logic
- Path traversal protection
- Config file permission enforcement
- Token rotation support
- Audit log integrity verification

**Security Posture**:
- **Current (v1.0)**: MEDIUM - Not ready for HIPAA environments
- **Target (v2.0)**: HIGH - Production-ready for HIPAA/PHI

### Performance (Go Optimizations)

**High Priority Optimizations**:
1. **HTTP Connection Pooling** (#14) - 30-50% faster API calls
2. **JSON Buffer Pooling** (#15) - 40-60% fewer allocations
3. **Batch Concurrency** (#16) - 3-5x faster batch operations
4. **Audit Pipeline** (#17) - 4-6x faster audit log loading
5. **Database Optimization** (#18) - 25-40% faster queries

**Go Techniques Used**:
- Goroutines & channels for concurrency
- sync.Pool for object reuse
- Connection pooling with http.Transport
- Context-based cancellation
- Prepared statements for database
- Channel-based pipelines
- Worker pool patterns

**Performance Targets**:
- API throughput: +30-50%
- Memory allocations: -40-60%
- Batch operations: 3-5x faster
- Audit loading: 4-6x faster
- Database queries: 25-40% faster

## User Impact

### Breaking Changes

**ONE breaking change** (for security):
- Secret input method changed from CLI arguments to stdin/prompt/env
- Affects 5 commands (user-credential, oidc)
- Migration is straightforward (pipe secrets or use env vars)
- Rationale: Prevents secrets in process list and shell history

### No UX Impact

**Security improvements** (95%+ transparent):
- Token encryption (automatic)
- TLS hardening (transparent)
- Audit encryption (transparent)
- Input validation (better error messages)
- Session timeouts (configurable, with auto-refresh)

**Performance improvements** (100% transparent):
- All optimizations are internal
- No CLI changes
- No output format changes
- No functionality changes
- Users just experience faster execution

## Key Decisions

### 1. Security First Approach

**Decision**: Prioritize security over performance in the timeline

**Rationale**:
- HIPAA compliance is a hard requirement
- Security issues are more critical than performance
- Performance can be improved incrementally

**Impact**:
- Milestone 1-2 focus entirely on security
- Milestone 3 focuses on performance
- Allows for security audit before performance work

### 2. Minimal Breaking Changes

**Decision**: Only one breaking change (secret input method)

**Rationale**:
- Maintain 100% feature parity promise
- Minimize migration burden on users
- Secret input change is security-critical

**Impact**:
- Users need to update 5 command invocations
- Migration guide provides clear instructions
- Overall upgrade is smooth

### 3. Go-Native Optimizations

**Decision**: Use Go's concurrency primitives instead of external libraries

**Rationale**:
- Leverage Go's strengths (goroutines, channels)
- Avoid dependency bloat
- Better performance and maintainability

**Impact**:
- 2-5x performance improvements
- Clean, idiomatic Go code
- Easy to understand and maintain

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

**Decision**: Allocate 25% of timeline to testing (2 weeks)

**Rationale**:
- Security changes must be thoroughly tested
- Performance optimizations need validation
- HIPAA compliance requires documentation

**Impact**:
- High confidence in v2.0 release
- Security audit can verify implementation
- Performance benchmarks prove improvements
